It is not black and white; it is common for people to change sides as they get older, or in response to becoming parents. Some persons have a foot in both camps, especially during the transition.\u003cp\u003eThere is a second sense in which it is not black and white. The agro is quantitative. If the bus shelter gets smashed once every few years, it is sufficient to just repair it. If it gets smashed every saturday night, that too expensive and more needs to be done.\u003cp\u003eThere are the yobs with spray cans making the graffiti and the property owners with the solvents and the origninal-colour paint getting rid of the graffiti. There is a threshold. If the makers are persistent enough and frequent enough the property owners become demoralized and give up. Then the graffiti makers can move on to tag a new, pristine area.\u003cp\u003eThere is a five year timescale on which the people who clean and mend become demoralized if they are faced with too much cleaning and mending. There is a thirty year, intergenerational timescale on which one attempts to bring up ones children to be on the clean and mend side.\u003cp\u003eThat is an uphill struggle, because, let\u0027s be honest, most neuro-typicals find that getting drunk and smashing things is more fun.\u003cp\u003eCory is focusing on the perpetrators. Does catching them and putting them in prison for 6 months reform them? Maybe, maybe not. Other people get a 6 month break from repairing the kicked-in door and cleaning up the vomit. That is vital for moral, both to keep going on the cleaning and mending, and to keep going on bringing up ones children to join the cleaning and mending team, and in having credibility with ones children when one says that the cleaners and menders are the good guys and the team to join.\u003c/font\u003e","id":2894657,"points":0,"parentId":2894657,"postId":2894657,"children":[]},{"postedBy":"mwill","postedAgo":"11 minutes ago","comment":"\u003cfont \u003eThere is local wireless multiplayer.\u003c/font\u003e","id":2894940,"points":0,"parentId":2895020,"postId":2894940,"children":[]},{"postedBy":"nodata","postedAgo":"11 minutes ago","comment":"\u003cfont \u003eThis table would be more useful if it would change two things:\u003cp\u003e1.
